# GoPickle2JSON

GoPickle is a Go library for loading Python's data serialized with `pickle`
and converting it to JSON. This code is derived from the nlpodyssey/gopickle
repo (or more precisely, the nsd20463/gopickle fork of the nlpodyssey repo)
with the pytorch parts removed, and the output changed from Go objects
representing python datatypes to JSON text.

# README from parent gopickle repo:

The `pickle` sub-package provides the core functionality for loading data
serialized with Python `pickle` module, from a file, string, or byte sequence.
All _pickle_ protocols from 0 to 5 are supported.


## How it works

### Pickle

Unlike more traditional data serialization formats, (such as JSON or YAML),
a "pickle" is a _program_ for a so-called _unpickling machine_, also known
as _virtual pickle machine_, or _PM_ for short. A program consists in a
sequence of opcodes which instructs the virtual machine about how to build
arbitrarily complex Python objects. You can learn more  from Python
`pickletools` [module documentation](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.8/Lib/pickletools.py).

Python PM implementation is straightforward, since it can take advantage
of the whole environment provided by a running Python interpreter. For this
Go implementation we want to keep things simple, for example avoiding
dependencies or foreign bindings, yet we want to provide flexibility, and a way
for any user to extend basic functionalities of the library.

This Go unpickling machine implementation makes use of a set of types defined
in `types`.
This sub-package contains Go types representing classes, instances and common
interfaces for some of the most commonly used builtin non-scalar types in 
Python.
We chose to provide only minimal functionalities for each type, for the sole 
purpose of making them easy to be handled by the machine.

Since Python's _pickle_ can dump and load _any_ object, the aforementioned types
are clearly not always sufficient. You can easily handle the loading of any 
missing class by explicitly providing a `FindClass` callback to an `Unpickler`
object. The implementation of your custom classes can be as simple or as
sophisticated as you need. If a certain class is required but is not found,
by default a `GenericClass` is used.
In some circumstances, this is enough to fully load a _pickle_ program, but
on other occasions the pickle program might require a certain class with
specific traits: in this case, the `GenericClass` is not enough and an error
is returned. You should be able to fix this situation providing
a custom class implementation, that jas to reflect the same basic behaviour
you can observe in the original Python implementation.

A similar approach is adopted for other peculiar aspects, such as persistent
objects loading, extensions handling, and a couple of protocol-5 opcodes:
whenever necessary, you can implement custom behaviours providing one or more
callback functions.

Once resolved, all representation of classes and objects are casted to
`interface{}` type; then the machine looks for specific types or
interfaces to be implemented on an object only where strictly necessary. 

The virtual machine closely follows the original implementation
from Python 3.8 - see the [`Unpickler` class](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.8/Lib/pickle.py#L1134).
